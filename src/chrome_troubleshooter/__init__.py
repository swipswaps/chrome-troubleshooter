# AUDIT-COMPLIANT IMPORTS: Updated to match consolidated module interface
# Following ChatGPT audit suggestion U-C1 for Single Source of Truth
# The audit version uses functions rather than classes for simplicity

# - Avoid importing everything to prevent circular dependencies
# - Match the actual implementation (functions vs classes)
# - Keep __all__ minimal to reduce API surface area

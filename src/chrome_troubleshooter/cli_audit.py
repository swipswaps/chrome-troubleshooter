"""
Typer-based CLI entry: launch, diagnostics, version.
Colour output uses Rich; exposed via console-script 'chrome-troubleshooter'.

This module implements the exact specification from the ChatGPT audit
for a clean, minimal CLI interface using Typer.

Key design decisions from the audit:
1. Typer for type-hint-driven CLI with autocompletion
2. Three core commands: launch, diag, version
3. Rich integration for colored output
4. Session-based diagnostic collection
5. Clean error handling and user feedback
6. Minimal dependencies (Typer includes Rich)

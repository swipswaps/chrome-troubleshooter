"""
Test suite for the audit-compliant CLI implementation.

This module implements the exact test specification from the ChatGPT audit
for validating the core CLI functionality.

CORRECTED VERSION: Fixed version test to match actual package version (1.0.0)
instead of the development version (0.0.x) assumed in the original audit.

Key testing principles from the audit:
1. Use Typer's testing framework for CLI testing
2. Test core functionality without external dependencies
3. Verify version command works correctly
4. Ensure tests are fast and reliable
5. No mocking of external systems in basic tests

AUDIT COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION:
✓ Uses CliRunner from typer.testing as specified
✓ Tests version command with CORRECTED expected output pattern
✓ Tests help commands for all three main commands
✓ Fast execution without external dependencies
✓ Comprehensive coverage of CLI interface

def test_version():
    """
    Test the version command returns expected output.

    This test implements the exact specification from the ChatGPT audit
    with CORRECTION for actual package version:
    1. Use CliRunner for isolated CLI testing
    2. Invoke the version command
    3. Verify successful exit code
    4. Check that version string contains expected pattern

    The test verifies that the version command:
    - Executes without errors (exit code 0)
    - Returns version information containing "1.0." (CORRECTED from "0.0.")
    - Handles package metadata correctly

    AUDIT COMPLIANCE WITH CORRECTION:
    ✓ Uses CliRunner as specified in audit
    ✓ Tests exact version command from audit specification
    ✓ Verifies exit code and output format
    ✓ CORRECTED: Matches actual version pattern from pyproject.toml (1.0.0)
